The original game is located [here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).
This version was forked from [aquaflame95's clone](https://github.com/AquaFlame95/aquaflame95.github.io), which was forked from [ozh's](https://github.com/ozh/cookieclicker). This game is made by none of the people listed here, except for Orteil and Opti who host the official webpage. This is for educational purposes.

Note that this version has a few modifications to the base game:
✅ Grimoire magic bar shows decimals to the hundredths place
✅ Sugar lump text changes color based on whether the lump is maturing, mature, or ripe
✅ Remove ad section
✅ Golden cookie and reindeer data
✅ An ascension upgrade helper for knowing what upgrades to save up for
✅ 'per second' text above big cookie now shows cookies gained per click as well
