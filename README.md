The original game is located at [here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).
This version was forked from [aquaflame95's](https://github.com/AquaFlame95/aquaflame95.github.io) clone, which was forked from [ozh's](https://github.com/ozh/cookieclicker).

Note that this version has a few minor modifications to the base game:
- Grimoire magic bar shows decimals to the hundredths place
- The game thinks the version is 2.042, so that anyone playing interchangebly between the Steam version and the online version can import and export without any hassle (note that most of the changes in 2.042 are related to the Steam game anyway)
- Sugar lump text changes color based on whether the lump is maturing, mature, or ripe
- Remove ad section
- Small text changes (mostly shortenings) here and there
- Shimmer info that renders dynamically*
- Error messages will be shown when the game fails to load [currently broken]
- An ascension upgrade helper for knowing what upgrades to save up for*
- Gambler's Fever Dream spell should cast properly (see [this](https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Grimoire#cite_note-1).)
