The original game is located at http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/.
This version was forked from [aquaflame95](https://github.com/AquaFlame95/aquaflame95.github.io)'s clone, which was forked from [ozh](https://github.com/ozh/cookieclicker)'s.

Note that this version has a few minor modifications to the base game:
- Grimoire magic bar shows decimals to the hundredths place (xx.xx instead of xx)
- Version is marked as 2.042 with 2.031 in parenthesis, so that anyone playing interchangebly between the Steam version and the online version can import and export without any hassle (note that most of the changes in 2.042 are related to the Steam game anyway)
- Sugar lump text changes color based on whether the lump is maturing, mature, or ripe
- Ad section is gone
- Small text changes (mostly shortenings) here and there
- Shimmer info that renders dynamically (when certain critera is met)
- Error messages will be shown when the game fails to load
